## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the azurestackhci.

``` yaml
title: Microsoft.AzureStackHCI
description: Azure Stack HCI management service
openapi-type: arm
openapi-subtype: rpaas
tag: package-preview-2024-02-01 
```

## Suppression

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: R3020
    from:
      - galleryImages.json
      - logicalNetworks.json
      - marketplaceGalleryImages.json
      - networkInterfaces.json
      - operations.json
      - storageContainers.json
      - virtualHardDisks.json
      - virtualMachines.json
      - virtualMachineInstances.json
      - virtualNetworks.json
    reason: Microsoft.AzureStackHCI is the correct name for our RP.
suppressions:
  - code: PathResourceProviderNamePascalCase
    reason: We had already gone to production with "HCI" in our namespace, so changing it to "Hci" now would be disruptive.
  - code: TopLevelResourcesListBySubscription
    reason: It is reporting issue for proxy extension resource which doesn't have use case to ListBySubscription as this resource will always tied to one parent resource only. Additionally, there is a 1:1 relationship between HybridCompute Machines and AzureStackHCI VirtualMachineInstances.
  - code: PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition
    reason: These are existing properties already supported as part of PUT extensions call. Same properties are being supported for extensions Patch now.  
    from: extensions.json
  - code: DefinitionsPropertiesNamesCamelCase
    reason: There is a false positive reporting the two letter acronym ID should be lower camel case. The property is correctly capitalized according to guidance. 
    from: logicalNetworks.json
  - code: ResourceNameRestriction
    reason: publisherName, publisherName etc didn't have a pattern initially, adding the constraint now will cause a breaking change.
  - code: DefinitionsPropertiesNamesCamelCase
    reason: We have a dependency on other team which is already using these values, changing it will break backward compatibility.
```
