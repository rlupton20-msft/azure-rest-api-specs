# This file configures spell checking. Items in "words" were initially populated
# with words that might be spelling errors. Review these words and take
# appropriate action. For more information, see: https://aka.ms/ci-fix#spell-check

# Spell checking is not case sensitive
# Keep word lists in alphabetical order so the file is easier to manage
